## 1. Introduction

The Titanic competition on Kaggle is a beginner-friendly project that involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. This notebook employs classic machine learning techniques to create a predictive model.

## 2. Dataset

### 2.1 Source
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition:
- [Train Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- [Test Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

### 2.2 Description
The dataset contains various features such as:
- `PassengerId`
- `Survived`
- `Pclass`
- `Name`
- `Sex`
- `Age`
- `SibSp`
- `Parch`
- `Ticket`
- `Fare`
- `Cabin`
- `Embarked`

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical features to numerical values
- Normalizing or scaling features if necessary

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves visualizing and summarizing the main characteristics of the data. Key steps include:
- Understanding the distribution of features
- Analyzing the relationship between features and the target variable (`Survived`)
- Visualizing data through plots and charts

## 5. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of the model. Steps include:
- Creating new features from existing ones
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection to identify the most important features

## 6. Model Building

Various classic machine learning models are built and compared, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The models are trained and hyperparameters are tuned using cross-validation techniques.

## 7. Model Evaluation

Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

## 8. Conclusion

The notebook concludes with a summary of findings and potential next steps for improving the model. This may include more advanced techniques or further feature engineering.
