1. Introduction
The Titanic competition on Kaggle is a beginner-friendly project that involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. This notebook employs classic machine learning techniques to create a predictive model.

2. Dataset
2.1 Source
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition:

Train Dataset
Test Dataset
2.2 Description
The dataset contains various features such as:

PassengerId
Survived
Pclass
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp
Parch
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Embarked
3. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes:

Handling missing values
Converting categorical features to numerical values
Normalizing or scaling features if necessary
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing and summarizing the main characteristics of the data. Key steps include:

Understanding the distribution of features
Analyzing the relationship between features and the target variable (Survived)
Visualizing data through plots and charts
5. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of the model. Steps include:

Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., family size from SibSp and Parch)
Encoding categorical variables
Feature selection to identify the most important features
6. Model Building
Various classic machine learning models are built and compared, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The models are trained and hyperparameters are tuned using cross-validation techniques.

7. Model Evaluation
Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

8. Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of findings and potential next steps for improving the model. This may include more advanced techniques or further feature engineering.
